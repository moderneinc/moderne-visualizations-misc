displayName: Composite recipe results
description: >
  The number of source files affected by each recipe. Recipes can be composed in hierarchical forms. The representation below is a Sankey diagram. \

  Reading left to right, the diagram shows the number of source files that cumulatively are changed by all recipes that are connected by successive doNext() chaining. The rightmost recipes are the "leaves" of this operation, i.e. the lowest level operations performed by a composite recipe. \

  **The Sankey diagram will be uninteresting for a recipe that isn't a composite.**
