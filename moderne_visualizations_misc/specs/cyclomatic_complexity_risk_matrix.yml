displayName: Cyclomatic complexity risk matrix
description: >
  Visualizes cyclomatic complexity as a risk matrix to help engineering leaders identify and prioritize areas for refactoring.
  The scatter plot shows repositories positioned by their number of high-complexity methods (x-axis) and average complexity (y-axis).
  Bubble size represents the number of classes in each repository. The plot is divided into four quadrants to categorize risk levels.

  - repository_filter:
      displayName: Repository filter
      description: >
        Only include data where the repository contains one of the following terms (case insensitive). 
         
        Branch names are appended to the repository name with a `/` separator.

        Examples:
         - The term `moderne` could be used to include any repository with `moderne` in the name or branch.
         - The term `moderne-test/main` could be used to filter to a repository named `moderne-test` with a branch named `main`.

  - complexity_threshold:
      displayName: Complexity threshold
      description: >
        The cyclomatic complexity value at or above which a method is considered "high complexity".
        Methods with complexity greater than or equal to this value will be counted in the risk analysis.
        Common thresholds: 10 (default), 15 (moderate), 20 (lenient).
