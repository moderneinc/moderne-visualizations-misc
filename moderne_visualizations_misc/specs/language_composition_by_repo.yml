        Which unit to use when measuring language compositions. Options include `lines` and `files`.

        `lines` will measure language composition by lines of code. `files` will count the number of files with each language.

        Because Moderne cannot parse all languages, you may want to know which files are not being parsed. Measuring by `lines` will
        only show you successfully-parsed files, as unparseable files cannot have their lines of code counted.
        
        Defaults to `lines`.
      valid:
        - lines
        - files
      required: false
