description: >
  This report shows different stack traces from the projects organized into clusters based on similarities. 
  Each cluster represents a group of related themes. 
  The legend provides a representative sample from each cluster to help understand the overall theme within the stack traces.
  _Note_: The representation of the stack traces are being projected into 2D for visualization purposes only, which is why some clusters might look spread out.
