name: io.moderne.CyclomaticComplexityHeatmap
displayName: Cyclomatic complexity heatmap
description: >
  Displays a heatmap visualization of cyclomatic complexity at the class level across repositories.
  Each row represents a class, and columns show different complexity metrics (method count, average complexity, max complexity, and total complexity).
  Color intensity represents normalized complexity values, helping identify the most problematic classes across multiple dimensions.

options:
  - repository_filter:
      displayName: Repository filter
      description: >
        Only include data where the repository contains one of the following terms (case insensitive). 
         
        Branch names are appended to the repository name with a `/` separator.

        Examples:
         - The term `moderne` could be used to include any repository with `moderne` in the name or branch.
         - The term `moderne-test/main` could be used to filter to a repository named `moderne-test` with a branch named `main`.
      required: false
  - top_n_classes:
      displayName: Number of classes to display
      description: >
        The maximum number of classes to display in the heatmap.
        Classes are ranked by a complexity score that combines total and average complexity.
        Default is 50 classes.
